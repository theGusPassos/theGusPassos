## Hi, glad to see you here.

I'm a developer based in Brazil currently working for [Lambda3](https://www.lambda3.com.br/).

- [This is my portfolio](https://theguspassos.github.io)
- [I also have a blog](https://theguspassos.github.io/blog)
- [and made some games](https://theguspassos.itch.io)

Besides the tech stuff, designing games makes my heart warm, so that's where most of my free time is spent on. Sometimes I also post non tech stories in [flashing line blog](https://flashingline.blogspot.com/). I'm also learning how to play the piano and how to draw properly, so maybe I'll add new links here in the future 🐱‍🐉.

My non productive hours are spent watching horror movies, playing online with friends and listening to music with questionable quality.

you can follow me on twitter ([@theguspassos](https://twitter.com/theguspassos)) if any of that is also of your interest, I'm always happy to interact with strangers online.
