### Hi there 👋


Hi, glad to see you here.

I'm a developer based in Brazil currently working for [Lambda3](https://www.lambda3.com.br/).

- [This is my portfolio](https://theguspassos.github.io)
- [I also have a blog](https://theguspassos.github.io/blog/#/)
- [I make games](https://theguspassos.itch.io/)

Besides the tech stuff, designing games makes my heart warm, so that's where most of my free time is spent on. Sometimes I also post some non tech stories in [flashing line blog](https://flashingline.blogspot.com/). I`m also learning how to play the piano since and how to draw and make 2d animations, so maybe I'll add new links here in the future 🐱‍🐉.

My non productive hours are spent watching horror movies, playing online with friends and listening to asian pop music.

you can follow me on twitter if any of that is also of your interest, I`m always happy to interact with strangers online.
