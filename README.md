## Hi, glad to see you here.

I'm a developer based in Brazil currently working for [Wizebank](https://www.wizebank.co/).

- [This is my portfolio](https://theguspassos.github.io)
- [I also have a blog](https://acadev.hashnode.dev/)
- [and made some games](https://guspassos.itch.io)

Besides the tech stuff, designing games makes my heart warm, so that's where most of my free time is spent on. I'm also learning how to play the piano and how to draw properly, so maybe I'll add new links here in the future üßê.

My non productive hours are spent watching horror movies and anime, playing online with friends and listening to music with questionable quality.

you can follow me on twitter ([@_guspassos](https://twitter.com/_guspassos)) if any of that is also of your interest, I'm always happy to interact with strangers online.
